This repository contains the version history for NoScript NSA Firefox (mobile)
add-on. The utility script `version.sh` and this README is based on
https://github.com/avian2/noscript.

Files in the `src/` subdirectory were extracted from XPI files downloaded from
http://noscript.net/nsa/, but slightly modified:

- The subdirectory named after the NoScript NSA version has been renamed to
  `noscript-nsa` for consistency.
- resource URLs of the form `noscript_3_5foo` have been modified to
  `noscript_@VERSION@` (applicable to most `.js`, `.jsm` and `install.rdf`
  files.
- The version number `3.5foo` in `bootstrap.js` has been substituted with
  `@VERSION`.
- Every file now consistently used LF as line endings instead of CRLF.
- Every text file now ends with a new line. This plays nicier with diff tools
  and vim.

Following copyright notice appears in the latest version at the time of
writing. Please refer to the files in the `src/` subdirectory for details.
